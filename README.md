In today’s assignment, you will explore non-linear least-squares estimation by applying the Gauss-Newton method to a real-world groundwater problem.You’ll begin by understanding and implementing the functional model in Python, then use the Gauss-Newton iteration to estimate the model parameters from observed water level data. Finally, you’ll visualize the fit, analyze convergence, and perform an Overall Model Test (OMT) to assess how well the model explains the observations.
