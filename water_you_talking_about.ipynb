    "In this exercise we will consider an aquifer: a subsurface reservoir where water is stored in the pores of a soil or rock formation. If this is unfamiliar to you, think of it as an underground sponge with water in it that responds slowly to change. A well has been installed with monitoring equipment such that a time series of water level in the aquifer has been obtained, and our objective is to create a mathematical model that captures the fluctuations of the water level with time.\n",

    "Water enters or exits the aquifer due to certain events, such as precipitation, evaporation or groundwater pumping. We assume that the water level in the aquifer is a linear combination of the events, allowing us to write the observation equation as:\n",

    "where $L(t)$ is the observed water level, $h_{i}(t)$ is an event that adds or removes water from the aquifer, $d$ is the base water level of the aquifer and $\\epsilon(t)$ is the noise (random error) term. In this exercise we will consider the response due to a single event, $h_k(t)$. Groundwater flows through pores in the aquifer much slower than the application of $h_k(t)$ at time $t_0$. Therefore, the aquifer responds to event $k$ according to a step-response function, $s(t-t_0)$, which has the general form illustrated in the figure below. If the event has a constant value and continues indefinitely after $t_0$, the aquifer will eventually reach a steady-state value $r$ (a scaling factor of $a=1$ is used).\n",
